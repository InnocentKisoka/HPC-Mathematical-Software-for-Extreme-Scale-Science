# HPC-Mathematical-Software-for-Extreme-Scale-Science
Project Overview

This project explores high-performance computing (HPC) software toolkits and libraries that are essential for computational science and engineering (CSE). 
The goal is to understand and utilize these tools for solving large-scale scientific computing problems. 
As a practical implementation, we solve the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions using Python and the PETSc toolkit.


Objectives

Provide a non-exhaustive list of HPC software toolkits and libraries for CSE.
Solve a boundary value problem (Poisson equation) using finite-difference discretization.
Implement the solution in Python using PETSc.
Run and benchmark the implementation on an HPC cluster.


Methodology

Study HPC frameworks such as BLAS, LAPACK, PETSc, METIS, and Trilinos.
Discretize the Poisson equation using second-order centered finite differences.
Formulate the discrete problem into a system of linear equations.
Implement and solve the problem in Python using PETSc.
Run the implementation on an HPC cluster with parallel computing techniques.

Tools & Technologies

Python (for implementation)
PETSc (for solving the linear system)
MPI (for parallel execution)
MATLAB/NumPy (for verification)
HPC Cluster (for large-scale execution)
